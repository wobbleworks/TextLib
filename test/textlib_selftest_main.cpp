///      @brief Standalone runner that executes every registered TextLib self-test with a pass/fail exit code.
///    @details Not part of the library archive. Including @ref TextLib/SelfTest.h registers every self-tested
///             module with @ref Core::selftest::Registry, so this runner does not name them individually — it
///             asks the registry to run them all and maps the failure count to the process exit code that a
///             continuous-integration job needs. The registry is active only in a @c DEBUG build, so the test
///             target defines @c DEBUG; @ref Core::selftest::testCount guards against a misconfigured build
///             passing vacuously with no tests registered.
